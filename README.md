## Goal

The goal of get_next_line is to read a file line by line in a C program. This function reads a single line from a file descriptor each time it is called and returns that line to the caller.

get_next_line is especially useful for reading large files or streams of data, where it may be impractical or inefficient to read the entire file or stream into memory at once. By reading one line at a time, programs can process the data more efficiently and with less memory usage.

Additionally, the get_next_line function is often used in conjunction with other functions to implement more complex functionality. For example, it can be used to implement command line interfaces, network protocols, or log file parsers.
